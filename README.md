☕ Café Review Website – Delhi & Noida
📌 About the Project

This is a small web project I made as a 1st year college student.
The idea is simple: people can write reviews about their favourite cafés in Delhi & Noida.
When you type your name, cafe name, review, and rating ⭐ → it instantly shows up on the page (no refresh needed 🚀).

I also added some scroll animations so the website.

🛠️ Tech Used

HTML → for the structure

CSS → for the styling + animations

JavaScript → for making the form work and adding smooth effects
